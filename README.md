# README

This is a small helper library handling all the database part of my cuecard management project. For now
just a basic database schema is defined and only SQLite will be supported as
a database backend.


## Development

The following tasks are on the TODO list:

1. Add events to the database
    1. events need to be recurring
1. Link playlists to events
